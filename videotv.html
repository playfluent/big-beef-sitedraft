    <h2>Community Roots</h2>
    <p>Big Beef’s engagement in film, video and television production probably ranks as the most voluminous and extensive component of it’s media production history. This is due to Big Beef producer Andy Valeri’s decades-long vocational involvement in community television, in which he’s been involved in the production and promotion of over a thousand hours of original programming, a good portion of it involving *live* television.</p>

    <p>This includes, among a wide range of one-off productions, the original cable television television series ‘<a href="https://bigbeef.com/vidbeef2.htm">THE EAT MORE CARP SHOW</a>,’ as well as the groundbreaking live interactive show “<a href="https://bigbeef.com/lovehour/index.htm">ANDY & PAT’S Groovy Cosmic Love Hour</a>,” which became a highly popular televised community forum in the pre-internet/social media age.</p>
        
    <p>Big Beef’s video archives also contain hundreds of hours of documentation of live music events and performances, many of them featuring bands produced and/or promoted by Big Beef Records, as well as videos featuring the likes of Billy Bragg, Guided By Voices, The New Duncan Imperials, Iodine, Robyn Hitchcock & The Egyptians, Troy Campbell, and more.</p>

    <p>Though not a Big Beef Production, later involvement as co-producer of the political news and discussion forum program “ <a href="####">UNCOMMON SENSE TV</a>” and extensive involvement in media policy issues (including through academic work, as well as active participation with the Alliance For Community Media), turned Valeri’s and Big Beef’s media production attention away from music and culture and towards the pressing political issues of the day. (The radio program “It’s All Happening” is in many ways an effort to return back to Big Beef’s cultural roots, and bridge some of that civic/cultural divide.)</p>
