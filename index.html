            <h2>Radio</h2>
            <p>From ‘DJ’ing’ mix tapes on cassettes as a kid in the 70’s, to being actively involved in a local community organizing effort to save WYSO radio as a locally-controlled media resource, Big Beef producer Andy Valeri’s personal connection to the power and joy of radio has been a lengthy and deep one.</p>

            <h2>Video/TV</h2>
            <p>Big Beef’s engagement in film, video and television production probably ranks as the most voluminous and extensive component of it’s media production history. This is due to Big Beef producer Andy Valeri’s decades-long vocational involvement in community television, in which he’s been involved in the production and promotion of over a thousand hours of original programming, a good portion of it involving live television.</p>
