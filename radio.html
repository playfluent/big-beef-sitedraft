        <h2>History of involvement</h2>
        <p>From ‘DJ’ing’ mix tapes on cassettes as a kid in the 70’s, to being actively involved in a local community organizing effort to save WYSO radio as a locally-controlled media resource, Big Beef producer Andy Valeri’s personal connection to the power and joy of radio has been a lengthy and deep one.</p>

        
        <p>His first experience with live radio was hosting an entire evening (when the actual scheduled DJ never showed up) on WDFM radio in State College, PA on Halloween night 1981. He was later enlisted by the legendary Dayton DJ the Rev. Cool to serve as a kind of co-pilot back-up for his now four decades-long running program "<a href="http://www.revcool.com/">Around the Fringe</a>", and has been serving in that role regularly since 2007.</p>

        <p> He’s since gone on to help serve as back up for Tod Weidner’s phenomenally good music program "<a href="#">The Jewel Case</a> (which ran on WYSO for over five years, before Tod’s professional music career became too full time to accommodate radio production), and now serves as a regular fill in for WYSO’s flagship daily prime time midday  music programming.</p>

        <p>"<a href="####">It's All Happening</a>" is Big Beef’s latest, and most extensively in depth engagement with radio production. It’s one that brings together much of it’s decades of creative production experience, and combining it’s musical/cultural aesthetic histories with it’s years of civic-political engagement and consciousness.</p>
